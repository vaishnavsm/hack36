# Safe Spaces - a modern approach

## What is a Safe Space?
In today's world, lots of people suffer from anxiety, depression and other such psychological illnesses. There are also many people who have suffered and subsequently try to live with horrible invasions of personal security or privacy, including rape and molestation. There are further people who have been pushed into conforming with the societies perhaps broken ideals, going insofar as to even not consider some of them human, such as the LGBTQ community (although enormous improvements have come up legally for transgenders). The commonality between all these people is that they find it quite difficult to trust the average individual, and thus find interacting with them difficult. This is generally because they don't know whether people will understand their situation, and even if they do, they worry that they may be victim-shamed or shunned away, as happens <i>too</i> commonly in our country.

A large section of these people attend councelling sessions or group gatherings with similarly affected people. This is because they can be absolutely sure that they won't react in a deregatory way. Such spaces are, as we use it here, safe spaces.

## App's Need

Safe spaces are already available to the people in need in certain circumstances. However, this means that they can't rely on safe spaces if they are out and about, or, say, travelling. This limits the mobility of these people, thus causing them to lose the footing they could have had otherwise. They are emotionally supressed and put under a lot of undue strain if they are to try.

Our app aims to create pseudo-safe spaces on demand, in real life.

There are plenty of apps that offer "virtual" safe spaces out there already, but these apps forgo the face that actually having a person in the real world is actually a lot more fulfilling to both individuals. Further, the kind of real-time help a person can offer in reality cannot be superseeded.

## Challenge - Guaranteeing that the person who's suggested is a fit.

Of course, the crux of the idea is providing a safe space, and this will fail to work if the person being suggested actually doesn't fit well with the current situation at hand. We take care of this, of course, with the powers of *MACHINE LEARNING*. To be more precise, we take the user information of the people who register, and analyse various factors including twitter feeds, mobile usage patterns, etc to figure out the characteristics of the people. We are thus able to indentify which kind of issues a person can tackle, which kind of issues a person should not be allowed to attend and so on.

Further, we use the average "rating" of how well the person is able to respond, along with factors from the above said algorithm in order to calculate a score for each person to show how well a person can respond. As it is extremely critical that this info not be manipulated, or in any way corrupt, we store it in a *blockchain*. This ensures that this score, which is what we use to qualify or disqualify the participant, is reliable all the time. Further, this blockchain is used to verify the identity of the user as well, which is a less commonly used feature of blockchains.

Because we use blockchains in such a way, we aren't limited to only using our own set of users. If other networks pop up using the algorithm designed here for other similar applications, the blockchain allows us to securely and reliably use the data of each other without any fear of malpractice and such. This in turn would lead to a much better support network over time.
